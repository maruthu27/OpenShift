OpenShift is a combination of Enterprise kubernetes and Docker.

OpenShift is a RedHat enterprise Platform As A Service(PAAS) components.

Self service platform like pivotal cloud foundry

Support Develop, deploy and manage containerised applications

Kubernetes manages containers on clusters and docker manages deployable images

kubernetes is an opensource system for automating deployment, scaling and management of containerised application.

Kubernetes provide cluster management and orchestrate containers on multiple host.

Docker
docker provide an abstraction for packaging and creating linux based lightweight container images.

Core concepts of OpenShift:
Containers and images: Building blocks for deploying your application.

Pods and Services: Allows container can communicate to each others in proxy connections.

Projects and Users: Provide space and users

Build and image streams: Allow you to build working images and react to new images

Deployments: Deployment life cycle

Routes: Exposing modules API

Templates: Allow you to create many objects

Source code management:Build and deployment for developers

Image management:Managing and promoting images scale and upload to the system.

Rest API management: Which expose each of the core objects

Controller management: Controller which reads those API apply changes the other objects

Automation life cycle management: Automatically apply changes to source code and version control

User interface management: Web front end for deploying and managing their applications.

Supporting languages: Java, node.js ,ruby, perl and php directly from RedHat and many others from partners.

OpenShift for CBX product:
CBX OpenShift cluster running on AWS with one Master node and multiple worker nodes.

How to deploy CBX products on OpenShift:
We can't deploy jar and npm packages directly on OpenShift like PCF so

Tested artifacts can be packed as a deployable docker images.

Then create manifest files and deploy on OpenShift.
